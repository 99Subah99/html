<h2>What is Lorem?</h2>
<h3>"Lorem" in HTML refers to "Lorem ipsum," which is a placeholder text used in web design to fill empty spaces with
seemingly random Latin words, allowing designers to focus on layout without getting distracted by actual content;
essentially, it's a dummy text that looks like real writing but has no meaning.</h3>
